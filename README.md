The goal of this system is to facilitate the exploration of research article collections using figures and includes the following main functionalities:

1. Searching for figures using keyword queries.
2. Searching for figures using different textual representations of a figure and different retrieval models.
3. Collecting user feedback in order to build test collections.
4. Exploring related figures for a seed figures using figure embeddings.
