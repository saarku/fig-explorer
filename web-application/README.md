# Web Application

To start the application, the [fig.explorer.config](https://github.com/saarku/fig-explorer/blob/master/fig.explorer.config) should be modified, and the app can then start by using the following command: *python server.py*. 
Note that the search engine server should be launced first (take a look [here](https://github.com/saarku/fig-explorer/tree/master/lucene-server) on how to do that).
